## Feature

- **SQL Audit** — Support the creation of SQL audit tickets with approval workflows and automated syntax checkers to
  validate submitted SQL statements for correctness, security, and compliance. Automatically generate rollback
  statements corresponding to the submitted DDL/DML operations for easy recovery when needed. Maintain a comprehensive
  history log of all SQL audit operations for traceability and auditing purposes.
- **Query Audit** — Our solution supports auditing of user query statements, including restrictions on data sources and
  databases, as well as anonymization of sensitive fields. Query records are also saved for future reference.
- **Check Rules** — The automated syntax checker supports dozens of check rules, catering to most of the automatic
  checking scenarios.
- **Privacy focussed** - Locally deployable and open-source solution ensures the security of your database and SQL
  statements. In addition to providing control over the infrastructure, the solution also includes encryption mechanisms
  to protect sensitive data before storing it in your database. This ensures that even if there is unauthorized access
  to the database, the encrypted data remains secure and unreadable. By combining local deployment, open-source
  transparency, and data encryption, we prioritize the privacy and security of your database and SQL statements.
- **RBAC** - In our platform, you can create and manage different roles and assign specific permissions to each role.
  This allows you to restrict users' access to query work orders, auditing functions, and other sensitive operations
  based on their assigned roles.
- **Message** - Support DingDing relay push to wechat
- **Authentication** - Supports 2FA multi-factor authentication
